# aalto-menu

Welcome to the Aalto menu bot repo.

This is a telegram bot that allows you to consult the lunch menus of the cafeterias in otaniemi (for now).

The data comes from https://kanttiinit.fi/ but since all university communications are on telegram why would you leave telegram while asking someone for lunch?

the bot also works inline! try writing @aaltomenubot on any chat to send the menu!
